### Required Python Libraries:

1) Tensorflow keras

2) Numpy

3) Cv2

4) Scikit learn (SkLearn)

5) Matplotlib


### Note:

1) Upload UTKFace.tar file to your google drive.

2) After doing step 1, You can directly mount your drive to your Google colab and a new folder will be created named UTKFace which is obtained by extracting the contents present in UTKFace.tar file.

3) And then Run all remaining cells in notebook.

4) For Improved performance Re-design neural network topology or you can increase size of image to 200*200 (original size of image present in UTKFace dataset).

5) For our convenience and by considering training resources we are having, we decreased image size to 144*144. If you have good compute power then you can increase that as well. So you can get more performance output.
